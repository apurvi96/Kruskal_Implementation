### Problem Statement:
Study and implement Van Emde Boas Tree data structure with application to kruskal
algorithm ( minimum spanning tree algorithm ) and comparison with other data structures which are
Binary Heap and Fibonacci Heap.
### Goal:
- Comparative study to undestand dictionary operations implementation of van Emde Boas Tree such as insertion, search, delete,
extract minimum.
- Achieve minimum time complexity to implement kruskal algorithm by using
suitable data structure.
### Implementation:
- Used binary heap, Fibonacci Heap and then vEB Tree to implement the algorithm which involved implementation of the dictionary opeartions- Insert, Delete, extract minimum.
- Observed behaviour of all the three implementation with different type of inputs and plotted the observed changes into a graph.

### Results:
Documented a report (report.pdf in documents section) of all the obversvations.
